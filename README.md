Java program for a Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The program allows users to add books, borrow books, return books, and display available books.

Features:
- Book Class: Represents a book with title, author, and availability.
- Library Class: Manages book inventory and borrowing/returning operations.
- User Class: Represents a library user who can borrow and return books.
- Main Class: Provides a menu-driven interface to interact with the system.


How It Works:
The program starts by initializing a Library and adding some default books.
A user enters their name to interact with the system.
The user is presented with a menu to:
- View available books
- Borrow a book
- Return a borrowed book
- View their borrowed books
- Exit the system
The system manages book availability, borrowing, and returning processes.
